# MachineLedPlatformExercise
This is the first exercise for the Machine Led Platform
# Exercise: Print a Greeting

Your task is to edit `main.py` so that it prints exactly:

```
Hello, MachineLed!
```

to standard output.

- Only edit `main.py`.
- Do not change the file name or add extra files.
- The grader will ignore this repository's `expected_output.txt` and use a platform-controlled canonical output for grading.
- Submit your repository URL to the platform frontend to trigger grading.

Good luck!
